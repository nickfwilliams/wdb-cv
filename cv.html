      <p>
        I’ve had a passion for technology and problem solving since I first got
        my Commodore 64 as a child. Since then, I’ve constantly kept abreast of
        the latest tech and computing developments, keeping up with the trends
        which allows me to assist friends and family whenever needed. In my free
        time, I’m an avid gamer, reader and, as Covid allows, swing dancer.
